# CO-Emissions-Dashboard

A Python/Dash application for interactive exploration and AI-powered insights of global and national COâ‚‚ emissions data.

## ðŸš€ Features ##
1. **Dual Datasets**
- ***Global:*** Annual COâ‚‚ from fossil fuels & cement (million metric tons of C)
- ***National:*** Per-country COâ‚‚ breakdown (thousand metric tons of C)
2. **Preprocessing & Cleaning**
- Year-based sorting
- Linear interpolation & back-filling of missing numeric values
- Outlier capping via IQR
- Automatic renaming of original dataset columns to a uniform schema
3. **Feature Engineering**
- Lag feature (`lag1`) and year-over-year % change (`YoY_pct`)
- Grouped computation for each nation
4. **Interactive Dashboard (Dash + Plotly)**
- ***Dataset selector:*** Switch between global and national data
- ***Country filter*** for national data
- ***Year range slider***
- ***Four core charts*** on a single grid:
    1. Total emissions time series
    2. Emissions by source type (area chart)
    3. Per capita emissions (line chart)
    4. Correlation heatmap
    5. Top 10 bar chart (by country or recent years)

- ***AI Insights:*** At-the-end summarization generated by `Google Gemini LLM`
5. **LLM Integration**
- Uses Google Generative AI (`gemini-2.0-flash`) to generate 3â€“5 concise, actionable insights
- Built-in retry/backoff logic
